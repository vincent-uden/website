This is the source code for my personal website. It was originally written using Astro 1.6 but and React for some components but I've since moved to Astro 3 with Solidjs for the components.

## Building and Running

As usual the website is built using `npm run build` and for development server with _HMR_ use `npm run dev`. It's a static website with no backend (this is subject to change pretty soon) and as such there are no environment variables to configure.
